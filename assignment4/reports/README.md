The reports are auto generated from the "numpy"_color2"gray/sepia".py files.
A normale report might look like:

```
Timing: numpy_color2gray
Average runtime running numpy_color2gray after 3 runs: 0.0032805601755777993 s
Average runtime running of numpy_color2gray is 550.8963637685022 times faster than python_report_color2gray.txt
Timing preformed using: (400, 600, 3)
```

All reports contain the average runtime for that report. and numpy conatains a comaprison to python
numba conatains the comparison to numpy and python.

All reports contain the shape of the image used in the calculation.

the timing for the numpy is on average faster than that of numba, but numba is faster over time.
